Dumb project for goofs
It generates "ESports-like" names.
Did this to tech myself NodeJS and deployment on Heroku.
I also got into NoSQL using MongoDB. The name data is all stored in a mLab MongoDB database.
Everything is being used at the free tier, so site and db access will be finicky.
It's live at:

www.esportszone.zone

Goals for the future:
Better styling
More effiecient use of database. It loads it all at once right now.
Massive code cleanup
