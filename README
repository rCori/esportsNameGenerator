First pass is just going to spit out a name from a json file.
Then we can get some logic to piece some names together.
Also very simple page design.
Going to try using PUG for templating
It's simple, this will work.

I have the pug templating in there.
Also css is importing just fine
Now I need a button to generate a new name(refresh the page)
Then look into hosting on Heroku
Then databases.
Maybe some better styling after that but I don't care too much.
And that should be good


apparently postgres interfaces with node with the pg package
and is available in a "Free tier" of heroku
That should be what I do.
First how do I host on heroku. That comes first.

first I need to also get this thing on git
