Dumb project for goofs
It generates "ESports-like" names.
Did this to tech myself NodeJS and deployment on Heroku.
It's live at:

https://warm-springs-77081.herokuapp.com/esports

Goals for the future:
Hooking up to a database(It's using a JSON file I have stuffed in there)
Get a real web domain
Better styling
